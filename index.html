          <h2>What is Classic Rock?</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Classic rock</span> is a US radio format which developed from
            the album-oriented rock (AOR) format in the early 1980s.primarily
            focusing on commercially successful blues rock and hard rock
            popularized in the 1970s AOR format.[1] The radio format became
            increasingly popular with the baby boomer demographic by the end of
            the 1990s.Although classic rock has mostly appealed to adult
            listeners, music associated with this format received more exposure
            with younger listeners with the presence of the Internet and digital
            downloading.[4] Some classic rock stations also play a limited
            number of current releases which are stylistically consistent with
            the station's sound, or by heritage acts which are still active and
            producing new music.[5] Conceptually, classic rock has been analyzed
            by academics as an effort by critics, media, and music
            establishments to canonize rock music and commodify 1960s Western
            culture for audiences living in a post-baby boomer economy. The
            music predominantly selected for the format has been identified as
            commercially successful songs by white male acts from the
            Anglosphere, expressing values of Romanticism, self-aggrandizement,
            and politically undemanding ideologies. It has been associated with
            the album era (1960sâ€“2000s), particularly the period's early
            pop/rock music.
